# Security Policy

The CaPyCLI community takes the security of its code seriously. If you think you have found a
security vulnerability, please read the next sections and follow the instructions to report your
finding.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report any potential security vulnerability via a public channel (mailing list,
github issue etc.).
Instead, create a report via https://github.com/sw360/capycli/security/advisories/new or contact
the maintainers thomas.graf [at] siemens.com via email directly.
Please provide a detailed description of the issue, the steps to reproduce it, the affected
versions and, if already available, a proposal for a fix.
You should receive a response within 5 working days. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability
by us, we will open a Security Advisory on github
and give credits for your report if desired. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
